# Technical Documentation - Week 01 Portfolio Website

## Objective

Build and finalize a professional single-page portfolio website for training submission, using only HTML, CSS, and Vanilla JavaScript.

## Final Feature Set

1. Boot/entry sequence with terminal-style loading experience.
2. Responsive dashboard with profile, social links, summary, metrics, and skill matrix.
3. About section with education timeline, focus areas, and toolchain tags.
4. Projects section with featured cards, outcomes, highlights, and source links.
5. Contact section with direct email, location, and social network links.

## Implementation Notes

- Data-driven rendering is handled in `src/js/script.js` through a structured `portfolioData` object.
- Section content is generated dynamically (skills, education, projects, contact links).
- Visual style is maintained with a futuristic black/green theme and responsive layout.
- Azure-based project is intentionally shown without GitHub source link (platform-specific work).
